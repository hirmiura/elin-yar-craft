[h2]Recipe[/h2]

Low-level equipment is learned from the beginning, but high-level (internal Lv. 10 or higher) equipment needs to be sparked.

[h2]Additions from mid-game[/h2]

No problem.

[h2]Deletion from mid-game[/h2]

There is no problem for items created after version 0.2.0.
There is a problem with items created before that.
This is because each item has a different ID from the original one.
This is done to separate materials and workbenches.

Specifically, the items you create will turn into junk (like gold nuggets in ELONA).

[h2]Competing with other mods[/h2]

I'm just adding item data with my own id, so it shouldn't be there. ......
